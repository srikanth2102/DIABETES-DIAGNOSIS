# DIABETES DIAGNOSIS

## MOTIVATION:
* Diabetes is a disease that occurs when your blood glucose, also called blood sugar, is too high.
* If Diabetes is left unattended it could turn diasterous.
* Hence early diagnosis of diabetes is essential.
* In this project we make models to diabetes diagnosis.

## TASK:
* In this project we diagnoise whether a person has diabetes or not.

## DATASET:
The dataset can be downloaded [here.](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database)

## LABEL:
* Given the above features we have to diagnois whether the person has diabetes or not.

## MODELS USED:
* Logistic Regression
* Decision Tree
* Support Vector Machine
* Random Forest
* Boosting(using decision tree)
* MLP Classfier
